This blog respects your privacy. It doesn’t collect any personal information directly. You can browse without creating an account, submitting forms, or providing any data.

However, as almost every other website, it uses **Google Analytics**, which may collect:
- IP address (anonymized)
- Browser type and version
- Device information
- Pages visited and time spent
- Referring websites
- Date and time of your visit

This data is collected in an aggregated, anonymous way and is used for statistics.

## Functional Cookies & Local Storage
This website uses cookies or local storage to remember your preferences, such as language and dark or light theme. These settings are stored only on your device and are not shared with third parties. They are considered strictly necessary for the proper functioning of the site and do not require consent under GDPR.

## Cookies & Consents
Google Analytics uses cookies to function. These cookies are only set after you give consent through the banner that appears on your first visit. You can also disable cookies in your browser settings if you prefer not to be tracked.

## Legal Basis for Processing
The processing of data through Google Analytics is based on my legitimate interest (Article 6(1) (f) GDPR) in analyzing traffic and improving the content.

## Data Retention & Sharing
I do not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties. Analytics data is retained according to Google Analytics default retention period. Google may process data as described in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
