Photography has been my hobby since '08, when I took out a loan and bought my first Canon 450D with a crappy 18–55mm lens. Later came a 50D paired with a wild 10–22mm and 55–250mm, a 5D MII + 24–105, a bunch of 50mm primes, and a 580EX II flash. I also shot with Zeniths, FEDs, Moskvas, Holgas, and my beloved Mamiya ZE.

Eventually, I traded it all for a modest Fuji X-T10 kit, which became my travel companion for nine intense years. These days, I shoot with an even more amateur-ish Fuji X100VI.

The gallery below starts with my recent photos and gradually dives into earlier layers.
