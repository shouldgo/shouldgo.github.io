I started this blog in 2009, back when reading was still a thing. It began in Russian, but now I’m happy to finally share some of my latest posts in English as well.

Photography has been my hobby since ’08, when I took my first loan and got a brand-new Canon 450D with 12 mpx of raw power (and a crappy 18-55 kit lens).

Later, I moved on to a 50D with a wild combo of 10-22 and 55-250, a 5D Mark II with a red-ring 24-105, a bunch of expendable 50-s, a 580EX II flash, and what not.

There were plenty of film cameras too: Zeniths, FEDs, Moskvas, Holgas, and my dear Mamiya ZE with that thick Sekor 50 f/2 bokeh and heavy Ilford Pan 400 grain.

At some point, I traded all my gear for a pretty amateur-ish Fuji X-T10 kit with the well-known 18-55 range. It took almost nine years of intense travel to kill it off!

By then, I could have just switched to a new iPhone and all its computational tricks, but its detached process and numbingly smooth results always made me nauseous.

So instead, I picked up a Fuji X100VI, a rangefinder-style point-and-shoot camera with a non-interchangeable 35 mm eq f/2 lens and a crazy cool hybrid viewfinder.

With all its quirks and limitations, this little camera gets me photography-horny again, and it’s always ready to satisfy since it fits right in my oversized pocket.

The only downside is that now I want more! Like buying back my old 5Dm2, finally grabbing a Minox 35, or dreaming about a proper Leica like I’m 17 all over again.

Not sure how long these symptoms will last, but until I’m back to normal, you’re kinda doomed to witness my inner teenager’s manifestations every now and then.
Sorry ’bout that.
