Slovenia was a pure coinsidense that turned out to be the greatest discovery of the year. Had zero expectations, got massively surprised. It is as neat as Denmark, as stunning as Switzerland, as chill and delicious as the rest of the Balkans.

The trip was random — scored a dirt-cheap flight to Trieste, found out there wasn’t much there, so ended up on a bus to Ljubljana because it seemed more promising.

This tiny country has it all — alpine peaks, mountain lakes, a seashore, stunning architecture, and the best quality of you-name-it among all the Slavic states.

I also happened to visit Denmark and Norway for the firs time this year. They were cool, but that was kinda expected. Slovenia is cool in an unexpectedly cool way!

It feels like there’s some kind of conspiracy. Everyone knows about Prague, Budapest, even Warsaw, but no one ever says ‘You should go see Ljubljana.’
