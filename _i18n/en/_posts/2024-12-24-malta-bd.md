Won’t pretend I’ve experienced much of Malta. Spent three full days there, strolled around the capital city of Valletta a bit, read some random stuff about its history and culture — hardly enough to draw any conclusions. But I’d happily revisit the first chance I get, and that’s more than I can say about most places.

So, instead of playing a smart-ass travel blogger, I’ll just share a bunch of photos and random facts that make this place one of a kind. The rest is up to you!

**Malta is the smallest EU country**, both by area and population. The archipelago covers around 300 square kilometers and is home to about 550k inhabitants.

**It’s one of the most densely populated** countries in the world, with over 95% of the main island (also called Malta, duh) being considered a single urban area.

**Maltese is a weird mix** of Arabic, Italian, English, and other languages, shaped by Malta’s long history of being fought over by just about every cocky prick in history.

**English is the second official language**, so you don’t have to worry. But you might want to worry, because English 'driving on the left side' is official too.

**Malta is very open to same-sex relationships**, yet one of the two EU states where abortion is strictly prohibited. Always thought you could have either both or none!
