Poland is supposedly one of the least LGBT-friendly countries in the EU. According to the Rainbow Map, it just gave up its last-place spot to Romania. One could argue that even that is still years ahead of the global average. But should that be enough?

I don’t think so. I believe that in any society, you can only feel as safe and have as many rights as its least protected and privileged.

And if my 'fatherland' taught me anything, it’s that the road from narrowly targeted repression to a full-scale erosion of human rights is shorter than two presidential terms.

So even if you can’t personally relate to certain struggles, do yourself a favor and stand up for egalitarian values — for the sake of your own future.
