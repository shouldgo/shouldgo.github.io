Hey there! I’m Dima — been going by that since 1989, but online you’ll find me as shouldgo. I’m into travel, photography, and combining the two whenever I can.

I grew up in the void of the Urals. Lived in Phuket, Moscow, Prague, Wrocław, and Cyprus. Nomaded throughout Europe before [settling in Kraków for good](/blog/love-poland/).

I worked for several startups as the digital marketing guy, then got tired and started my own digital agency, and eventually launched [a meditation app](http://praktika.app/).

I started this blog in 2009, back when reading was still a thing. It began in Russian, but I’m happy to share my latest posts in English too.

You can reach me on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/dima.afonin), [Telegram](http://telegram.me/shouldgo), or by [email](mailto: shouldgo@me.com) — but only if you really have to!
