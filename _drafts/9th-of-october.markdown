title: Much more than 3 years away from now

The challenge is not prepared to face the challengers, only the scavengers will get their profit when the beat will be drowned by silence. Into the night with my resurrected fears. Into the hope the daylight will be strong enough to completely clear us. Into the dive with no power to fight all the fevers. Out of the wild and down on the ground along with the shreds of a billion windows.

Happy 9th of october. Those who travel faster than light are going too fast walking the way straight to the past. Every lightstamp is to be clicked through to be forgotten, thou I still do not believe it can not be forgiven nor continued.
