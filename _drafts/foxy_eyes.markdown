* * *

Foxy eyes reflect horizons  
When there are only material values  
And the word filled with poison  
It is my only toy  
Which I employ.

The challenge is not prepared  
To face the challengers.  
Only the scavengers  
Will get their profit  
When the beat  
Will be drowned by silence.

Their prices are too low  
To accept the fact  
That the foxy eyes reflect  
You and your own bag.

Every step that you make makes you closer  
To the place which is far away from home  
Into the night with no fear  
Into the light which is clear  
Into the fight with your fever  
Into the wild and up to the only window.

go. 2010
